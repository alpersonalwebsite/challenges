# FullStack and FrontEnd job interview quick notes
A few days ago, I quit my job; after a weekend of pseudo-leisure, I started -actively- to apply to different vacancies through LinkedIn. I donÂ´t use other services even when I could radically increase my chances. Just "IN" and some nice third-party recruiters. Why am I avoiding popular utilities like *Hired*...?
