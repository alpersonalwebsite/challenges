# FullStack and FrontEnd job interview quick notes

A few days ago, I quit my job; after a weekend of pseudo-leisure, I started -actively- to apply to different vacancies through LinkedIn. I don´t use other services even when I could radically increase my chances. Just "IN" and some nice third-party recruiters. Why am I avoiding popular utilities like *Hired*...?

First, because I do believe that one should create his/her own career (no one better than one knows what one needs): you have to think it, you have to convert those desires of "musts/shoulds" into bullets points and be aware of your requirements. Mine is -mainly- positive Culture”.

Second, because I don´t want to be like a sham ornament on display waiting for a good soul to take me home.
There are different stages in life. Now, after working for a prudential time, I can be a little picky and pull apart as much time as I need to make the proper research of each company. If you don´t have greater pressures, I strongly recommend you to do this. Maybe, it is not going to pay-you-back at short term, nevertheless It will do it in an incremental way and, mainly, it will constitute your best investment and your bigger asset: “Knowledge is Power” (Sir Francis Bacon?)
