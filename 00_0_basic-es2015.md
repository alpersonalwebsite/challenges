# ES6 or ES2015

//TODO: New things. Quick check.


**let and const** (replace var)

* For variables that never change use `const` (abbr. constant)
* For the rest, use `let`. Avoid using var.

---

**Arrow functions**

Preserve the context of `this` (keyword) during the runtime.

*Before es2015:* function example

```javascript
function add(num1, num2) {
  return 'The results of this operation is ' + (num1 + num2);
}

add(2,3);
```

*With es2015:* function example

```javascript
const add = (num1, num2) => {
  return `The results of this operation is ${num1 + num2}`
}

add(2,3);
```
In both cases the output will be `The results of this operation is 5`

This is a "quick and dirty example". In a real world application (functional and pure programming), you probably will have...
1. `add(number, number, nameSpace = 'string')` receiving an extra argument for the message. In this case, you could also set a parameter with a default value, so, if you don´t explicitly pass it, it will use the default one.

```javascript
const add = (num1, num2, message = 'The results of this operation is') => `${message} ${num1 + num2}`;
console.log(`${add(2,3, 'The sum is:')}`)
```

2. **Preferred approach:** `add()` will just do what´s supposed to do... ADD! This pattern is "one function per need". So, we will have the `add()` function to sum and return and we will have as well other variable holding the message.

```javascript
const add = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;
const message = 'The results of this operation is';

console.log(`${message} ${add(2,3)}`)
```

*Note:* We could also create a new function, `showMessage('string', fn)`, pass the function `add()` as argument and log to the console the message (including add() return) from that function. However, this is extremely granular unless there´s a real possibility of reuse.
